Here are the key metrics that can be implemented with simple code:

**Format Consistency Tests**
-  Markdown heading structure (regex for H1, H2, etc.)
-  List formatting (bullet points, numbering)
-  Code block detection
-  Table structure validation

**Content Quality Checks**
-  Response length (character count vs. target)
-  Compression ratio (summary vs. original)
-  Language consistency (detect language switches)
-  Name/entity validation (against source text)

**Retrieval Quality**
-  Precision at K (% of relevant chunks in top K results)
-  Recall at K (% of important info retrieved)
-  MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank of the first relevant result)

**Performance Metrics**
-  Response time
-  Token usage
-  API costs per request
-  Error rates

Each of these can be implemented with basic Python code and executed in milliseconds.

**Connecting Metrics to Outcomes**
These technical metrics map to three levels of business impact:

1. **Algorithm Metrics (the ones above)**
   - Run every morning
   - Take seconds to execute
   - Provide immediate feedback

2. **User Feedback**
   - Thumbs up/down ratings
   - Time spent reading
   - Follow-up questions asked
   - Features used (copy, share, edit)

3. **Business Outcomes**
   - User retention
   - Task completion rates
   - Customer satisfaction scores
   - Support ticket volume

This kind of test:

-  Runs in milliseconds
-  Provides clear yes/no results
-  Can be automated
-  Costs nothing to execute
